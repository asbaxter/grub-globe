# Grub Globe

Grub Globe is a web application that provides users with food recipes from around the world. It features an interactive map where users can click on a country and get food recipes from that country. Grub Globe is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses APIs to fetch data about countries and their food recipes.</br>

## How it Works

Grub Globe uses an API to fetch data about countries and their food recipes. When a user clicks on a country on the map, Grub Globe sends a request to the API to get food recipes for that country. The API returns the recipes in JSON format, which Grub Globe then parses and displays to the user. </br>

## How ChatGPT Helps

To make the process of writing the code for Grub Globe easier, we are using ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. ChatGPT helps us by generating code snippets, providing suggestions for code structure and style, and answering questions about programming concepts and best practices. Even this README was written with the help of ChatGPT! </br>

## Just Starting Out

When I first began using ChatGPT to help write the code for this website, I was excited to see what it could do. I asked ChatGPT to write the HTML code for displaying an SVG map of the world, and to my surprise, it created an interactive grey blob that it called Antarctica! </br>

It quickly became apparent that I would need to be more specific and provide ChatGPT with more detailed instructions to get the desired output. I learned that while ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can help generate code, it needs clear and concise instructions to produce the results I need. </br>

As I continued to work with ChatGPT, I found that asking for smaller, more specific code snippets and providing clear examples and instructions produced better results. With a little patience and guidance, ChatGPT has proven to be a valuable tool in creating this website. </br>

## Filling the Database

To create a comprehensive recipe database for each country, I needed to gather data from a variety of sources. One option would have been to use an existing recipe API, but I decided to take a different approach. Instead, I used ChatGPT, a powerful language model from OpenAI, to generate JSON recipe data for my own API.</br>

Using ChatGPT allowed me to create unique recipe data for each country, tailored to my specific needs. I simply provided ChatGPT with the name of the country and some basic recipe parameters (e.g. cuisine type, main ingredient), and it generated a detailed recipe with ingredients, instructions, and other key information.</br>

While this approach required more effort on my part than using an existing API, it allowed me to have complete control over the recipe data and ensure that it was accurate, high-quality, and unique. By using ChatGPT, I was able to create a truly one-of-a-kind recipe database that sets me apart from other recipe sites and services.</br>
