# Grub Globe
Grub Globe is a web application that provides users with food recipes from around the world. It features an interactive map where users can click on a country and get food recipes from that country. Grub Globe is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses APIs to fetch data about countries and their food recipes.</br>

## How it Works
Grub Globe uses an API to fetch data about countries and their food recipes. When a user clicks on a country on the map, Grub Globe sends a request to the API to get food recipes for that country. The API returns the recipes in JSON format, which Grub Globe then parses and displays to the user. </br>
